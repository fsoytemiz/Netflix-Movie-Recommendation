# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation

This folder contains the work for a Netflix Prize Data. 
The goal of this project is to create a personalized movie scoring and recommendation system based on the user's previous movie ratings
through machine learning training. The recommender system will be able to predict users rating for a new movie they haven't seen.

The data was extracted from the Kaggle:
